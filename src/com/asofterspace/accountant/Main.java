	 * TODO:
	 * Export (as menu item), with Export as German CSV and Export as English CSV as sub-items
	 * make tax a dropdown edit field
	 * pre-select category based on title
	 * if we ever have more than 20 Mio â‚¬ in any field, switch to using long instead of int... :)
	 * prevent undoing more than 64 steps, or redoing more steps than have been undone...
	 * if someone clicks on "Open on Disk" and the folder for that particular month (or even year)
	 *   does not yet exist, automatically create it, including all the subfolders (however, only
	 *   if a base location was actually specified in the config - not if the settings are just null!)
	 * also handle timesheets (and automatically base invoices on timesheets)
	 * add to outgoing invoices a "date paid" which can be null if not yet paid, or a date can be
	 *   entered for when it was paid
	 * edit existing entries
	 * output monthly accounting json that we can save long-term just in case
	 * output yearly accounting information
	 * output yearly accounting json
	 * output information on how to integrate accounting information with other programs
	 *   (online USt, third party ESt, etc.)
	 * automatically add years when the current date is later than an existing year
	 * perform and log finance days (1, 1.5 and 2 - each performance could be done through
	 *   the accountant, as much as possible being automated, and it having been done can
	 *   be logged, such that upon next startup it can be shown which next finance day is
	 *   now outstanding, if any, and which might come up over the coming weeks etc.)
	 * generate outgoing invoices (as pdfs?) with just a few clicks, and have them logged
	 *   immediately etc.
	 * automatically read incoming emails and scan for incoming invoices
